def validate_json_schema_completeness(schema_input):
    """
    Background
        - We already do have schema validation implemented with json schema library.
        - However, we had situations when a schema had empty properties, but existing json schema validator didn't flag
            it as invalid/incomplete (it happened with Shopify schema).

    The purpose of this function is
        - to flag schema as invalid if it is incomplete.

    :param schema_input: JSON schema. It can be dictionary/JSON object or string.

    What the function does

        Clean input:
            - If it's not a string, we'll convert it to string.

        Validation steps:
            - If schema has empty {} inside its "properties", "type" or "items", fail schema completeness validation check.
                - To help the end user, we'll tell them which part of schema has empty {} (properties, type or items).
            - If schema has empty {} elsewhere, a warning is logged.

        Rationale for our validation steps:
            - empty props, type or items clearly indicate invalid/incomplete schema
            - {} elsewhere also indicates invalid/incomplete schema, it may cause pipeline failure,
                but we want to relax the rules a bit
                and we don't want to be too heavy-handed
